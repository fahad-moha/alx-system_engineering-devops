## What is the main role of a web server?

The main role of a web server is to deliver web content to clients or users upon request. It handles incoming HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests from clients, such as web browsers, and responds with the requested content, which can include web pages, images, videos, or other resources.

Web servers are responsible for processing and fulfilling client requests by locating and retrieving the requested content from the server's file system or database. They also handle various other tasks, including authentication, security, caching, and load balancing to ensure efficient and reliable delivery of web content.

## What is a child process?

In computing, a child process is a term used to describe a process that is created by another process, known as the parent process. When a parent process spawns or forks a child process, the child process inherits certain attributes and resources from its parent.

Child processes are independent entities that can execute their own code and have their own memory space. They can perform tasks concurrently with the parent process or execute different operations altogether. Child processes allow for parallel execution, multitasking, and the division of work across multiple processes.

## Why do web servers usually have a parent process and child processes?

Web servers often use a parent-child process model to handle incoming client requests efficiently. The parent process, also known as the master process, is responsible for managing the overall operation of the server, such as accepting incoming connections and handling configuration changes. It typically runs with higher privileges and controls the creation and termination of child processes.

When a client request arrives, the parent process forks a new child process to handle that specific request. The child process is responsible for processing the request, generating the appropriate response, and sending it back to the client. By creating child processes, web servers can handle multiple requests concurrently, improving performance, scalability, and responsiveness.

The use of child processes provides several benefits, including:

1. **Concurrency**: Child processes allow the server to handle multiple client requests simultaneously, enabling better utilization of system resources and improved responsiveness.

2. **Isolation**: Each child process operates independently, providing isolation and fault tolerance. If one child process crashes or encounters an issue, it does not affect the operation of other child processes.

3. **Resource Management**: Child processes can distribute the processing load across multiple CPU cores, enabling efficient utilization of system resources and improving performance under heavy traffic.

4. **Security**: Child processes can run with lower privileges than the parent process, reducing the potential impact of security vulnerabilities or attacks.

## What are the main HTTP requests?

The main HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) requests are:

1. **GET**: The GET method is used to retrieve information or resources from a server. It requests the server to send a representation of a specific resource identified by a URL. GET requests are idempotent, meaning multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request.

2. **POST**: The POST method is used to submit data to be processed by a server. It sends data in the body of the request, typically used for creating or updating resources on the server. POST requests are not idempotent, as multiple identical requests may result in different outcomes.

3. **PUT**: The PUT method is used to update or replace an existing resource on the server. It sends the complete updated representation of the resource to the server. PUT requests are idempotent, as multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request.

4. **DELETE**: The DELETE method is used to delete a specified resource on the server. It requests the server to remove the resource identified by the URL. DELETE requests are idempotent, as multiple identical requests should have the same effect as a single request.

5. **PATCH**: The PATCH method is used to partially update a resource on the server. It sends the changes to be applied to the resource, rather than sending the complete updated representation. PATCH requests are not always idempotent, as multiple identical requests may have different outcomes depending on the server implementation.

6. **HEAD**: The HEAD method is similar to the GET method but only retrieves the headers of the response, without the actual content. It is often used to check the availability or retrieve metadata of a resource without transferring its entire contents.

There are other less commonly used HTTP methods as well, such as OPTIONS, TRACE, and CONNECT, which serve specific purposes in certain situations.

## What does DNS stand for?

DNS stands for Domain Name System. It is a decentralized hierarchical naming system that translates human-readable domain names, such as www.example.com, into IP addresses that computers can understand. DNS serves as the backbone of the internet's naming infrastructure, enabling users to access websites and services using easy-to-remember domain names.

## What is DNS's main role?

The main role of DNS (Domain Name System) is to translate domain names into IP addresses. When a user enters a domain name in a web browser, the browser needs to find the corresponding IP address of the server hosting that domain to establish a connection. DNS provides a distributeddatabase system that stores and manages the mapping between domain names and IP addresses.

DNS performs several important functions:

1. **Domain Name Resolution**: DNS resolves domain names to their associated IP addresses. This process involves querying DNS servers to obtain the IP address corresponding to a given domain name.

2. **Caching**: DNS servers can cache the results of previous DNS lookups. This caching mechanism helps improve the efficiency and speed of subsequent DNS queries by reducing the need to query authoritative DNS servers for every request.

3. **Load Balancing**: DNS can be used for load balancing purposes by distributing incoming requests across multiple servers. DNS servers can return different IP addresses for the same domain name, rotating the responses or selecting the IP address based on various algorithms.

4. **Redundancy and Fault Tolerance**: DNS allows the use of multiple DNS servers to provide redundancy and fault tolerance. If one DNS server is unavailable or fails to respond, other DNS servers can be queried to obtain the IP address for a domain name.

5. **Mail Exchange (MX) Records**: DNS supports MX records, which specify the mail servers responsible for accepting incoming email for a specific domain. MX records help route email messages to the correct mail server.

6. **Other Record Types**: DNS supports various types of resource records, including A records (mapping domain names to IPv4 addresses), AAAA records (mapping domain names to IPv6 addresses), CNAME records (aliases for domain names), TXT records (used for storing text-based information), and more.

Overall, DNS plays a critical role in translating domain names into IP addresses, enabling users to access websites, send emails, and interact with various network services using human-readable domain names rather than having to remember complex IP addresses.


Within the context of DNS (Domain Name System), TTL stands for Time to Live. It is a value associated with a DNS record that specifies the duration for which the record should be considered valid or cached by resolving systems, such as DNS resolvers or clients.

When a DNS record is queried, the DNS server includes the TTL value in the response. Resolving systems then store the record in their cache along with the TTL value. During the TTL period, subsequent queries for the same record can be answered by referring to the cached copy instead of querying the authoritative DNS server again. This caching mechanism helps reduce the load on DNS servers and improves the overall efficiency of DNS resolution.

Once the TTL expires, the resolving systems consider the cached record as stale and discard it. They will then query the authoritative DNS server again to obtain the most up-to-date record. The authoritative DNS server can update the record with a new value, and the process repeats.

TTL values are specified in seconds and can vary for different DNS records. Shorter TTL values, such as a few minutes or seconds, allow for more frequent updates but can increase the DNS query load. Longer TTL values, such as several hours or days, reduce the query load but may result in longer delays before changes propagate across the DNS system.

By adjusting the TTL values for DNS records, administrators can control how frequently resolving systems query the authoritative DNS servers for updated records and balance the trade-off between caching efficiency and responsiveness to changes.
