# Networking Basics 

## What is localhost/127.0.0.1?
- `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` refers to the loopback network interface of a device.
- It is a reserved IP address that represents the device itself.
- When a program or service is configured to listen on the localhost address, it can be accessed only from the local machine.

## What is 0.0.0.0?
- `0.0.0.0` is a special IP address that represents all IP addresses on the local machine.
- It is used as a placeholder or wildcard address to bind or listen on all available network interfaces.
- When a program or service is configured to listen on `0.0.0.0`, it can accept connections from any available network interface.

## What is /etc/hosts?
- `/etc/hosts` is a file on Unix-like operating systems that maps hostnames to IP addresses.
- It is used to override or supplement the DNS (Domain Name System) lookup for specific hostnames.
- Entries in `/etc/hosts` allow the local machine to resolve domain names to IP addresses without querying external DNS servers.

## How to display your machine's active network interfaces?
To display the active network interfaces on your machine, you can use the following commands depending on your operating system:

- On Linux: Use the `ifconfig` or `ip addr` command.
- On macOS: Use the `ifconfig` or `ipconfig getifaddr` command.
- On Windows: Use the `ipconfig` or `Get-NetAdapter` command in PowerShell.

These commands will provide information about the network interfaces, including their IP addresses, MAC addresses, and other network configuration details.
