## What Bash scripting should not be used for

Bash scripting is not suitable for complex or resource-intensive tasks that require high performance or extensive processing. It is primarily designed for automating system administration tasks, executing shell commands, and performing simple file manipulations. For more complex tasks involving advanced algorithms, data processing, or large-scale applications, other programming languages like Python, Java, or C++ are more appropriate.

## What is an API

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules, protocols, and tools that enables different software applications to communicate and interact with each other. It defines how software components should interact, what data formats to use, and what operations can be performed. APIs allow developers to access and utilize the functionality of other software systems or services without needing to understand the underlying implementation details.

## What is a REST API

A REST (Representational State Transfer) API is a type of API architecture that adheres to a set of principles and constraints for designing networked applications. REST APIs are based on the HTTP protocol and utilize standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform operations on resources. They commonly use URLs (Uniform Resource Locators) to identify and access resources, and they can return responses in different formats such as JSON or XML.

## What are microservices

Microservices are an architectural approach to building complex applications by dividing them into small, independent, and loosely coupled services. Each microservice focuses on a specific business capability and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Microservices communicate with each other through APIs and can be implemented using different technologies and programming languages. The aim of microservices is to achieve agility, scalability, and maintainability by breaking down monolithic applications into manageable components.

## What is the CSV format

The CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format is a file format commonly used for storing and exchanging tabular data. In a CSV file, each line represents a row, and the values within a row are separated by commas (or other specified delimiters). CSV files are simple and widely supported, making them a popular choice for data exchange between different applications and systems.

## What is the JSON format

The JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format is a lightweight data interchange format that is human-readable and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is widely used for representing structured data in web applications and APIs. JSON is based on a subset of the JavaScript programming language and consists of key-value pairs, arrays, and nested objects. It has become the de facto standard for representing data in many web-based systems.

## Pythonic naming conventions

In Python, following specific naming conventions enhances code readability and consistency. Here are the recommended Pythonic naming styles:

- **Package and module name style**: Use lowercase with underscores (snake_case). For example: `my_package`, `my_module`.
- **Class name style**: Use CapWords or CamelCase. For example: `MyClass`, `MyClassWithMethods`.
- **Variable name style**: Use lowercase with underscores (snake_case). For example: `my_variable`, `my_list`.
- **Function name style**: Use lowercase with underscores (snake_case). For example: `my_function`, `process_data`.
- **Constant name style**: Use uppercase with underscores (CAPS_CASE). For example: `PI`, `MAX_VALUE`.

These naming conventions improve code readability and maintainability, and they align with the Python community's best practices.

## Significance of CapWords or CamelCase in Python

CapWords or CamelCase is typically used for naming classes in Python. It involves capitalizing the first letter of each word within the name, without using underscores. This style is commonly used to distinguish class names from other naming conventions in Python. It enhances readability and conforms to the naming conventions followed by many Python developers.
