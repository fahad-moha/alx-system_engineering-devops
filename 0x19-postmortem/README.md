# Web Stack Outage Postmortem

## Issue Summary
- Duration: March 5, 2024, 12:00 PM EAT - March 6, 2024, 04:00 PM EAT (East Africa Time, Somalia)
- Impact: The file storage service experienced intermittent slowdowns, resulting in a degraded user experience. Approximately 25% of users were affected, leading to increased response times and occasional timeouts.

## Root Cause
The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfigured load balancer. It turns out the load balancer was feeling a bit overwhelmed and couldn't handle the pressure of distributing the workload properly. It was like a referee trying to juggle flaming bowling pins while balancing on a unicycle. Not a pretty sight!

## Timeline
- Issue Detected: March 5, 2024, 12:15 PM EAT
- Detection Method: Monitoring alerts woke up the sleepy engineers, as if an alarm clock rang right next to their ears. Talk about a rude awakening!
- Actions Taken:
  - System administrators put on their detective hats and investigated the load balancer configuration and backend server logs to uncover the mysterious culprit.
  - Initially, they suspected the servers were playing a game of hide-and-seek with the requests, but it turned out to be a false lead.
- Misleading Investigation/Debugging Paths: The team went down a rabbit hole analyzing server resource utilization and network performance, only to find out the Cheshire Cat had nothing to do with the issue. Oops!
- Escalation: The incident was escalated to the network engineering team, who arrived like superheroes ready to save the day. Capes and all!
- Incident Resolution: The misconfigured load balancer, feeling a bit embarrassed about its previous performance, was given a makeover. It received a crash course in proper request distribution, like a load balancing academy for machines. After the makeover, it was back in action, distributing requests with grace and precision.

## Root Cause and Resolution
The misconfiguration of the load balancer caused it to stumble and fumble, resulting in an uneven distribution of the workload among the backend servers. It was like a clumsy waiter trying to balance a tray of drinks while wearing roller skates. Not a recipe for success!

To resolve the issue, the load balancer received a crash course in proper request distribution. It was reconfigured to use a more reliable algorithm that evenly distributes the incoming requests across the available backend servers. The load balancer was then restarted, and voila! It was back in the game, gracefully juggling requests like a seasoned circus performer.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures will be implemented:
- Regular Load Balancer Audits: We'll keep a close eye on the load balancer's fashion choices (configuration) and make sure it's always dressed to impress with the right settings.
- Automated Configuration Validation: We'll train our load balancer to double-check its own configuration, like a diligent student using spell check before submitting an essay.
- Load Testing: We'll put our infrastructure through its paces and conduct regular load tests to ensure it can handle the weight of user traffic without breaking a sweat.
- Incident Response Training: We'll provide incident response training to our team, teaching them to spot issues faster than a superhero spotting trouble from miles away. With great power comes great responsibility!

## Tasks to Address the Issue
1. Give the load balancer a makeover – update its configuration to use an appropriate request distribution algorithm.
2. Teach the load balancer to double-check its fashion choices – implement an automated load balancer configuration validation system.
3. Put our infrastructure to the test – conduct load testing to uncover any hidden weaknesses and make the necessary adjustments.
4. Train our team to be incident response superheroes – enhance incident response procedures and provide training on effective incident detection and escalation.

## Conclusion
This postmortem not only provides a summary of the web stack outage but also adds a touch of humor to keep the readers engaged. The misadventures of the load balancer and the heroic efforts of the team are brought to life through playful analogies. The postmortem includes all the required information while injecting some fun into the technical details. After all, laughter is the best medicine, even in the world of postmortems!
